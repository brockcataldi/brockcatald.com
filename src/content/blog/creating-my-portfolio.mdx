In my career, I've been involved in building a ton of websites, but it's usually a team effort with an established brand already in place. This project, however, is from the ground up—and it feels like a Sisyphean task. That being said, it helps when you build stuff in the correct order, usually I shoot for a content-first strategy, but I didn't do all that, just shooting from this hip, starting with design because that's fun as hell. But no matter how out of order I always believe that before you start a site, you need to identify its goals and purpose.

## Goals & Purpose

- **Exist.** I've owned this domain since 2016. I briefly threw together a site right after college, but since 2019 it's been nothing more than a dead domain. Time to change that.
- **Showcase.** The site's purpose is to house my favorite works, experiments that someone might find useful (which I'll group into a “projects” post type), and articles like this one—where I can shout into the wind about things I feel strongly about.

## Abstracts

Now comes the scavenger hunt portion of the build: identifying the design tokens for my personal brand.

### Typography & Spacing

About a year ago, I read _Better Web Typography for a Better Web_ by Matej Latin. It pulled me deep into the intricacies of typography—pairings, how designers and developers calculate sizing and spacing, and everything in between.

After some research, I settled on **Gloock** for headings and **Sen** for body text. For spacing and sizing, I decided to use [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), a fluid typography system where sizes are clamped based on the viewport, with upper and lower bounds tied to a modular scale. Let me tell you it is _fucking dope_.,I don't even remember how I stumbled across it, but it deserves a shoutout

The whole strategy has aged gracefully since I was first introduced to the concept. Compared to this shit

```css
h1 {
  font-size: calc(32px + (52 - 32) * ((100vw - 300px) / (1920 - 300)));
}
```

that was an experimental line I tried before the `clamp()` function was widely available. The results were in simplest terms, fucking ass, which is why I was so hesitant about fluid typography at first.

#### Typography Settings

| Fields     | Min Viewport | Max Viewport |
| :--------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Width      | 360px        | 1240px       |
| Font Size  | 16px         | 18px         |
| Type Scale | 1.2          | 1.25         |

#### Spacing Settings

I didn't actually change anything from the typography.

| Fields    | Min Viewport | Max Viewport |
| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Width     | 360px        | 1240px       |
| Font Size | 16px         | 18px         |

### Colors

Since I was starting from absolute zero, my first draft in Figma was just a simple black and white comp. But eventually, I needed some actual colors, so I turned to the trusty [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) generator.  

My scientific process was:  

1. Smash the spacebar until something looks promising.  
2. Slap it on the comp.  
3. Immediately regret everything and return to spacebar smashing.  

After several rounds of **that**, I finally landed on some colors I actually liked, which was just a slightly off shade of black and a lighter orange for an accent. From there, I ran them through [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/) to generate gradient shades, giving me a nice palette of neutrals to work with.
