Over the course of my career, I've contributed to building many websites—most often as part of a team, working within the framework of an established brand. This project, however, is different. It's entirely my own, built from the ground up, and at times it has felt like an uphill battle.

That said, the process becomes far more manageable when approached with structure. While I typically advocate for a content-first strategy, this time I began with design. It was the most exciting entry point, and it allowed me to explore ideas more freely. Still, regardless of where you begin, I believe every website should start with a clear understanding of its goals and purpose.

## Goals & Purpose

- **Establish a Presence.** I've owned this domain since 2016. Aside from a brief post-college experiment, it has remained dormant since 2019. It's time to change that.
- **Showcase Work.** The site will serve as a home for selected projects, experiments, and articles—ranging from technical explorations to personal reflections.
- **Leverage Astro.** After exploring modern JAMStack frameworks, [Astro](https://astro.build/) stood out as the ideal foundation for a performant, content-driven site.

## Building the Design Language

The next step was to define the design tokens that would form the foundation of my personal brand.

### Typography & Spacing

About a year ago, I read _Better Web Typography for a Better Web_ by Matej Latin, which deepened my appreciation for the nuances of typography—pairings, sizing, spacing, and rhythm.

After research and experimentation, I selected **Gloock** for headings and **Sen** for body text. For sizing and spacing, I adopted [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), a fluid typography system that uses `clamp()` to scale type responsively within defined bounds. This approach has proven both elegant and reliable, especially compared to earlier, more cumbersome methods such as:

```css
h1 {
	font-size: calc(32px + (52 - 32) * ((100vw - 300px) / (1920 - 300)));
}
```

#### Typography Settings

| Fields     | Min Viewport | Max Viewport |
| :--------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Width      | 360px        | 1240px       |
| Font Size  | 16px         | 18px         |
| Type Scale | 1.2          | 1.25         |

#### Spacing Settings

| Fields    | Min Viewport | Max Viewport |
| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Width     | 360px        | 1240px       |
| Font Size | 16px         | 18px         |

### Iconography

Since the site will use minimal iconography, I've chosen [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for their simplicity and clarity, downloading only the specific icons I need.

### Colors

The initial design began in black and white, but I soon needed a more defined palette. Using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), I iterated through countless combinations before settling on a slightly off-black paired with a light orange accent.

To expand this palette, I used [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/) to generate gradient shades, resulting in a versatile set of neutrals and accents.

## Design Process

### Identifying Requirements

The first step was to outline the essential pages and components needed for a functional portfolio. While I don't plan to include a contact form (I'm not pursuing freelance work), I will provide a link to my LinkedIn for those who wish to connect.

#### Pages

- Homepage
- 404 Page
- Articles Archive
- Work Archive
- Single Article
- Single Work
- About Page

#### Components

- Header (Navigation)
- Footer
- Hero Section
- Featured Work Roll
- Work Roll
- Featured Articles Roll
- Articles Roll

### Integrating Design Tokens

Initially, I manually applied colors and typography settings in Figma. However, I quickly discovered plugins that streamlined the process:

- [Leonardo Converter](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1013391800762935476/leonardo-converter)
- [Utopia / Fluid Type + Space Calculator](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/951884648789524000/utopia-fluid-type-space-calculator)

These tools proved invaluable in maintaining consistency and efficiency.

## Adding Personality

While sketching logo concepts on my partner's iPad, I developed two signature-based marks: one more formal, the other more expressive. The latter resonated with me, inspiring a broader design direction.

The idea is to balance a clean, professional portfolio with subtle, toggleable 'hand-drawn' elements—scribbles, doodles, and annotations—that reflect my personality and design process. This duality allows the site to function as both a polished showcase and a more personal creative space.
